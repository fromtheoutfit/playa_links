playa_links
===========
playa_links is free fieldtype meant to accompany [Pixel & Tonic's Playa](http://pixelandtonic.com/playa) fieldtype.

It creates a fieldtype which will allow your users to easily click through to any parent or child elements linked to from your current entry from any of your Playa fields.

## Settings 
The only setting allows you to choose if links will open in a new tab (target="_blank") or open in the current window. Note, if you select "Open in current window", any edits made on the current page will not be saved.
